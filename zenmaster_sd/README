Overview
========

zenmaster_sd is an alternate ROS master

It is designed for system where it is desireable to run one master
node per machine.  Masters go on to discover each other via Bonjour.
When a new remote master is discovered, it is added to a local list of
remote master addresses. From this point on, local XMLRPC calls to
register/unregister subscribers/publishers/services/params are echoed
to the remote masters.  Also, at first discovery, the remote master is
syncronized with the local master in terms of existing
publishers/subscribers/services/params.  

It is necessary (and sometimes beneficial) to blacklist certain
topics/services/parameters.  See the example launch file for more
details. 

Requirements
============

This code uses the pybonjour python module which in turn relies on a
running avahi daemon for linux.  

zenmaster_sd must be placed in $ROS_ROOT/bin/ with something like the
following:

	sudo cp bin/zenmaster_sd $ROS_ROOT/bin/

Additionally, the base ROS installation must be patched. Note that 
this will only work with the Box Turtle release (and possibly earlier).

        cp ros_dist_changes.patch $ROS_ROOT/
        patch -p0 < ros_dist_changes.patch

Simple Example
==============

(1) Simply run roslaunch the file launch/zenmaster_sd.xml on machine A
(2) Repeat on machine B (obviously, they should be on the same local
    network)
(3) Start a simple publisher on machine A (i.e. "rostopic pub
    /testing geometry_msgs/Point32 '{x: 1.0, y: 2.0, z: 3.0}'")
(4) The topic should show up more or less right away on machine B and
    the connection can be tested with "rostopic echo /testing"
